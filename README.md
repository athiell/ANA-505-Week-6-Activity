# ANA-505-Week-6-Activity
Included SVM algorithm, K Means algorithm, and C50algorithm

SVM accuracy: 97.3%

K Means accuracy: 88.7%

C50 accuracy: 84.4%

As shown above, the accuracy percent was highest for the SVM Algorithm.
I found that each of the corresponding scripts showed the predicted results in a very different manner. In my opinion, the SVM was the easiest to visualize due to the initial testing for correlation by reviewing the parameters in the plots.

Additional comments included in script files!
